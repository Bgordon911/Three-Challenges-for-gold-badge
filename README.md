"# Three-Challenges-for-gold-badge" 
I have completed all three of my GoldBadge Challenges. The first challenge that i completed which was the Cafe challenge , I  challengused the crud method. I only used the create, read, and delete method to complete my challenge. The second challenege that I completed, which was the Claim challenge I utilized three methods which were create, read, and delete. These were the three methods that i structered my project around. The third challege i completed was the badge challenge. The badge challenege was difficult because it was dealing with dicitionaries. I used three crued methods to initialize my final project.I performed unit test on all three to make sure my repository checked out.
